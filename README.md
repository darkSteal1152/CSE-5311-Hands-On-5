CSE 5311 Assignment 5

Min Heap python class structure is implemented and shown in min_heap.py
1.  build_min_heap builds the heap initially and heapifies the passed in array
2.  heapify sets the parent to be a value smaller than the children throughout the heap
3.  get_root function gets the root node or smallest value from the heap
4.  pop function removes the smallest or root node and then re heapifies
5.  heap stores any data type since python
6.  output.txt shows the result of the code including:

7.  array to min heap generation
8.  get root function
9.  pop and result of new heap
10.  insert new root node and result
11.  insert new node and result
